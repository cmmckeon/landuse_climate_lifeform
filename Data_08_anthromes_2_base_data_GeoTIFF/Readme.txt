*DESCRIPTION*
This archive contains base data on Potential Natural Vegetation based on Ramankutty & Foley (1999) and land areas in square kilometers used in the Anthromes (version 2) dataset of Ellis et al. (2010).  Additional data, including anthrome maps and other inputs used for analysis are at:

*DATA FORMAT*

1) DATA ARCHIVE (download format)
This zip archive contains global grids in geographic projection at 5 arc minute resolution in GeoTIFF format (ASCII GRID and ESRI GRID formats also available ). To access the grids, the zipfile must be downloaded and extracted into a single folder.  Two grids are provided:

potveg.tif = Potential Natural Vegetation classes modified from Ramankutty & Foley 1999
DATA CITATION: Ramankutty, N. and J. A. Foley. 1999. Estimating historical changes in global land cover: Croplands from 1700 to 1992. Global Biogeochemical Cycles 13:997-1027.

land_km2.tif = land area per cell in km2

2) DATA FILES (GeoTIFF file format)
Each GRID file is a complete global data layer for the given year in geographic projection at 5 arc minute resolution (0.083333333 degrees per cell, varying from 85 km2/cell at the equator, to 11 km2/cell at the poles).  This resolution produces a 4320 x 2160 global grid.
